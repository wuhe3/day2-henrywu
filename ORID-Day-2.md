// ORID-Day-2

1. Objective
- Code Review
- Unit Testing
-- later bug found, more $ you spent
- TDD
-- how to write? workflow; format
-- avoiding over design
- Mars Rover
-- how to build up the unit test from 0

2. Reflective
Fruitful

3. Interpretive
I've learned - Writing unit tests before implementation is crucial because:
-- Early detection of edge cases and bugs
-- Reduces long-term maintenance costs

I once found a critical bug in core methods near project completion. It took 2 full days to fix and refactor everything - a costly lesson about the importance of early testing.

4. Decisional
I will apply TDD when I code. Through proper TDD, I aim to improve code quality and development efficiency while preventing similar issues in future projects.
